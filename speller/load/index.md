# Speller: Load

Implementing `load` is quite a challenge! That's because when implementing load, your data structure (the hash table) will become real as you progress. For example, to load the dictionary, you will have to **insert** each word into your hash table, which means that the linked lists inside the hash table have to exist.

After you have implemented `load`, the remaining functions will be a little bit easier because they can be based on the hash table that's already loaded. But more on that in the next few days!
