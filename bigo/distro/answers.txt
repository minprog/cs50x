Enter the algorithmic complexity in the form O(...) in each of the answer fields below. 
Be sure to use a * for multiplication, ^ for to the power of, and log() for the logarithmic function. 
Do note that in Computer Science the logarithmic function is base 2 by default, so it suffices to write log instead of 2log.

For example:
- O(1)
- O(n)
- O(n^2)
- O(2^n)
- O(log(n))
- O(n * log(n))

One final note, be sure to rewrite O(n*n) to O(n^2).
