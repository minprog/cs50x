# Scrabble

> Bij deze opdracht is het helemaal prima om samen te werken met één medestudent. Zorg dat je gezamenlijk op één scherm kunt kijken en echt samen het probleem probeert op te lossen. Heeft iemand een goed idee, dan moet die zorgen dat de anderen het ook begrijpen. De bedoeling is dat alle samenwerkers evenveel hebben bijgedragen aan de opdracht. Iedereen levert uiteindelijk een eigen versie in.

Determine which of two Scrabble words is worth more.

    $ ./scrabble
    Player 1: COMPUTER
    Player 2: science
    Player 1 wins!


## Background

In the game of [Scrabble](https://scrabble.hasbro.com/en-us/rules), players create words to score points, and the number of points is the sum of the point values of each letter in the word.

| A | B | C | D | E | F | G | H | I | J | K | L | M | N | O | P | Q  | R | S | T | U | V | W | X | Y | Z  |
| - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | -- | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | -- |
| 1 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 4 | 2 | 4 | 1 | 8 | 5 | 1 | 3 | 1 | 1 | 3 | 10 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 4 | 4 | 8 | 4 | 10 |

For example, if we wanted to score the word `Code`, we would note that in general Scrabble rules, the `C` is worth `3` points, the `o` is worth `1` point, the `d` is worth `2` points, and the `e` is worth `1` point. Summing these, we get that `Code` is worth `3 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 7` points.


## Getting Started

Copy the "distribution code" (i.e., starter code) from [https://github.com/minprog/cs50x/raw/2020/scrabble/scrabble.c](https://github.com/minprog/cs50x/raw/2020/scrabble/scrabble.c) into a new file in your IDE called `scrabble.c`.

You can also download the distribution code by running the command `wget https://github.com/minprog/cs50x/raw/2020/scrabble/scrabble.c` in CS50 IDE.


## Implementation Details

Complete the implementation of `scrabble.c`, such that it determines the winner of a short scrabble-like game, where two players each enter their word, and the higher scoring player wins.

*   Notice that we've stored the point values of each letter of the alphabet in an integer array named `POINTS`.

    *   For example, `A` or `a` is worth 1 point (represented by `POINTS[0]`), `B` or `b` is worth 3 points (represented by `POINTS[1]`), etc.

*   Notice that we've created a prototype for a helper function called `compute_score()` that takes a string as input and returns an `int`. Whenever we would like to assign point values to a particular word, we can call this function. Note that this prototype is required for C to know that `compute_score()` exists later in the program.

*   In `main()`, the program prompts the two players for their words using the `get_string()` function. These values are stored inside variables named `word1` and `word2`.

*   In `compute_score()`, your program should compute, using the `POINTS` array, and return the score for the string argument. Characters that are not letters should be given zero points, and uppercase and lowercase letters should be given the same point values.

    *   For example, `!` is worth `0` points while `A` and `a` are both worth `1` point.

    *   Though Scrabble rules normally require that a word be in the dictionary, no need to check for that in this problem!

*   In `main()`, your program should print, depending on the players' scores, `Player 1 wins!`, `Player 2 wins!`, or `Tie!`.

### Hints

*   You may find the functions `isupper()` and `islower()` to be helpful to you. These functions take in a character as the argument and return a boolean.

*   To find the value at the `n`th index of an array called `arr`, we can write `arr[n]`. We can apply this to strings as well, as strings are arrays of characters.

*   Recall that computers represent characters using [ASCII](http://asciitable.com/), a standard that represents each character as a number.


### How to Test Your Code

Your program should behave per the examples below.

    $ ./scrabble
    Player 1: Question?
    Player 2: Question!
    Tie!

    $ ./scrabble
    Player 1: Oh,
    Player 2: hai!
    Player 2 wins!

    $ ./scrabble
    Player 1: COMPUTER
    Player 2: science
    Player 1 wins!

    $ ./scrabble
    Player 1: Scrabble
    Player 2: wiNNeR
    Player 1 wins!
