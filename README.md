# CS50x University of Amsterdam

These are adaptations of CS50's problems for use at the University of Amsterdam's programming minor and other programming courses.

## Generating distros

Run `make` in the top-level directory to generate zipfiles for any distros. Any directory called `dist` is considered, but each must contain its own `Makefile` for generating the distro. See, for example, the directory `find/dist`.
